# Lakbay Baguio

A responsive, single-page Baguio itinerary planner built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Open the project

1. Extract the project folder.
2. Open it in VS Code.
3. Run `index.html` with the Live Server extension.

Opening `index.html` directly also works for most features, but Live Server is recommended for Google Maps previews, browser location access, and local testing.

## Main features

- Sticky three-step navigation that follows the active planner section
- Trip planning for 1 to 5 days
- Victory Liner, Gov. Pack, Genesis Transport, and JoyBus starting points
- Early-arrival baggage-storage suggestions for supported terminals
- 48 destination cards with compact horizontal scrolling on mobile
- Visible destination names, popular badges, and strong selected states
- Selected-place chips with individual remove buttons and Clear all
- Automatic destination selection by travel theme
- Route ordering based on distance, time windows, and visit duration
- Night-only scheduling for Baguio Night Market
- Walk, jeepney, and taxi icons, fare estimates, and step-by-step directions
- Google Maps destination previews and external multi-stop route links
- Local browser saving, itinerary copying, printing, and mobile responsiveness

## Color palette

```text
#819A91  Primary sage
#A7C1A8  Secondary sage
#D1D8BE  Soft sage
#EEEFE0  Cream background
#FFA02E  Orange highlight
#FFEF91  Yellow highlight
```

## Destination image size

Replace destination images inside:

```text
assets/img/destinations/
```

Recommended dimensions:

```text
800 × 500 pixels
```

A larger `1200 × 750` image also works. Keep the same filename and use an 8:5 landscape ratio. CSS uses `object-fit: cover`, so images crop neatly without changing card dimensions.

Examples:

```text
assets/img/destinations/burnham-park.jpg
assets/img/destinations/camp-john-hay.jpg
assets/img/destinations/igorot-stone-kingdom.jpg
```

Destination labels are HTML text, not part of the photos, so names remain visible after images are replaced.

## Google Maps

The project uses:

- Standard Google Maps search URLs
- Google Maps directions URLs for each route leg
- Multi-stop Google Maps URLs for each itinerary day
- A no-key Google Maps place preview iframe

A paid Google Maps API key is not required for the current implementation. The embedded preview shows a selected place, while the route buttons open full directions in Google Maps.

## Data and fare notes

`assets/js/data.js` contains:

- Attractions and side trips
- Approximate coordinates
- Planning hours
- Suggested visit durations
- Activity suggestions
- General jeepney-loading guidance
- Terminal baggage suggestions

Transport instructions, attraction hours, storage availability, and fares can change. The interface deliberately labels them as estimates and tells tourists to verify details locally.
